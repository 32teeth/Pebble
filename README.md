## Versioning

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/32teeth/Pebble/tags).

## Update Script

An update script (`update.sh`) is included to automate versioning, changelog generation, and releasing. 

### How to Use the Update Script

To use the update script, run:

```bash
./update.sh
```

The script will perform the following steps:

1. **Version Update**: It will read the current version from `package.json`, increment the patch version (or minor/major if necessary), and update the `package.json` file with the new version.
2. **Changelog Update**: It will generate a new entry in the `CHANGELOG.md` file with placeholder changes.
3. **Build SCSS**: It will run `npm run sass:build` to compile the SCSS files.
4. **GitHub Release**: It will commit the changes, tag the new version, and create a new GitHub release with autogenerated notes.

For more details on how the update script works, refer to the `update.sh` file.
